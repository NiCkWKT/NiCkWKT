### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


This is Nick. I am currently a year 2 computer science student in CUHK.

I am quite passionate about programming since I can build several interesting products myself. I am currenly working on some web development stuff. I learnt the basics about web programming myself such as HTML, CSS, Javascript. Then I switched to learning React since it is a very popular framework and I find it very useful in building front end stuff.

I have created a recipe app using React. You can check out my repository.
